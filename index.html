          <h3 class="post-title">What a weekend!</h3>
          <div class="post-content">
            <p>My phone crashed and would not restart. Big panic to get it fixed but there is no available appointments. So bought a new phone, then got the old phone fixed in the end. All rushed. Emily went to gymnastics. Then spent most the rest of the day playing with messy consequences. Spag bol for dinner. Not bad considering I nearly didn't want to cook! 
            <br>
            Big start to Father's Day the next day! Happy Father's Day darling. You are a wonderful father to our daughter. She is very lucky to have you to love and guide her. Hope you loved your breakfast in bed and big box of presents! I then rushed out to get presents and then rushed back to pick them both up to go to a family friend's child's birthday party! It lasted longer than expected. I had to cancel my surprise Father's Day plan at the Bavarian for Robbie. But great twist is that Emily got to ride a cute shaggy friendly Shetland pony.

            Today I changed the water for our fish tank and prepared the larged birthing separation box as we may be getting babies soon!!

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Today is the independence day of my origin country, Malaysia. It is a significant one because it is the first in many years where my family feel happy with the government and that they are heard and represented. What more does one need from their leaders.</p>

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>My husband is in aviation, but <em>codes a lot</em>, for work and fun. My <strong>daughter</strong> started learning to code this year. Now I am the only one who doesn't know how to code.</p>
            <p>Gotta change that. This is the first step. Thanks, mimo and Atom!</p>

            <p>This is Justine from another day and another time. This is the past, maybe the present, but there is no such thing as present because immediately after one notices the present, it has already passed.</p>
